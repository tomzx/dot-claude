Create a spec directory and write a specification file per major feature for the code in this directory and its subdirectories.
Make sure to have a section "requirements" using MUST/SHOULD/MAY.
Use se descriptive names for the specification files, e.g., `authentication.md`.
Do NOT number the specification files, e.g., `01-feature-spec.md`.
Do NOT suffix the specification files with "-spec", e.g., `feature-spec.md`.
